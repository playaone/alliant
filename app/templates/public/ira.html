                                                        The purpose of an IRA is to save for retirement, so this tax-advantaged savings vehicle is specifically designed to discourage investors from withdrawing funds before turning age 59Â½. If you do so, the IRS imposes a 10 percent penalty on top of the income taxes you pay on the withdrawal. There are some exceptions that allow early withdrawal without penalty, so please see a tax professional for more detailed tax advice or visit the IRS website.

                                                        Yes. Effective January 1, 2015, the IRS imposed the new IRA Rollover rule which stipulates that an IRA owner may complete only one IRA-to-IRA rollover per 365 days, regardless of how many IRAs you own, without differentiating between Traditional, Roth and SEP IRAs. This change of only one rollover per year will only affect rollovers, and will not have any impact on trustee-to-trustee transfers. The once-per-365-day rule does not apply to the direct rollover of 401(k) funds to a Traditional IRA.
